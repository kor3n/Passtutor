**Password Tutor - A tool for remembering passwords... Using your mind :)**


Goal/Reason
-----------

I wanted to remember passwords without writing them down or using a password manager
I looked on the internet and mostly found password managers all over the place
so I am learning python at the minute and i decided to program the tool in python


Running
-------

* python Passtutor.py -p [password]
* Optional Arguments are -lT and -n, -lT for how long you get to look at the password in seconds.
* -n for Incorrect Character Notification. when you get a character wrong, show you which you went wrong on.

usage: Passtutor.py [-h] [-p PASSWORD] [-lT LOOKTIME] [-n]


Requirements
------------

* Linux (will add other os's later)
* python 2.7
